# Reverse Engineering
This document contains challenges meant to go along with the video presentation on reverse engineering

## Setup
```
cd reverse-engineering
make
```
## Basic Reversing
1. Use the "challenge1" file. Determine the input necessary to print out "success." This will be the flag.

## Disassembly
1. Using GDB and objdump, find the flag in the "challenge2" binary

## Decompilation
1. Decompile the "challenge3" binary, using Ghidra (Download [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases)), and determine the output to reach the flag print out. You can also use an online decompiler, such as [dogbolt](https://dogbolt.org/)
