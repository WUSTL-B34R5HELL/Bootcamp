# Bearshell New Member Bootcamp
Resources for each topic video, including the powerpoint and challenge source.

Each topic uses Docker to setup a challenge environment. To follow along with the videos on your local computer, complete the "Docker Setup" instructions. Then, each topic will have instuctions on how to start up the challenge instance.

For more hands-on practice outside of the videos, check out the [pwn.college dojo](https://pwn.college/dojo/bearshell~83271640/join), which has challenges for each topic. All dojo challenges are hosted remotely making it super simple to get started!

## Docker Setup
1. Setup Docker locally. For Mac, follow this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). For the Linux environment, follow this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) from the docker docs. Also, follow the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to add your user to the docker group. If you have issues setting this up, feel free to reach out over Slack.
