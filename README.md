2. Setup Docker. For Mac, follow this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). For the Linux environment, follow this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) from the docker docs. Also, follow the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to add your user to the docker group.
